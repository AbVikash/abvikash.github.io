            <h3>GLAUCOMA DETECTION</h3>
            <p>My passion for utilizing artificial intelligence for real-world impact led me to undertake a project focused on glaucoma detection using deep learning. This project aimed to develop an automated system capable of identifying signs of glaucoma in retinal images. By training convolutional neural networks on a diverse dataset of eye scans, I created a model that can assist in early glaucoma diagnosis. The potential to revolutionize eye healthcare and enhance patient outcomes drives my dedication to AI-driven medical advancements.</p>
